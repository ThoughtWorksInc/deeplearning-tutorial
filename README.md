# Tutorial

**DeepLearning.scala** is a DSL for creating complex neural networks.

With the help of DeepLearning.scala, regular programmers are able to build complex neural networks from simple code. You  write code almost as usual, the only difference being that code based on DeepLearning.scala is [differentiable](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/), which enables such code to evolve by modifying its parameters continuously.
